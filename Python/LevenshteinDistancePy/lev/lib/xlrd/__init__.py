#
# Open a spreadsheet file for data extraction.
#
# @param filename The path to the spreadsheet file to be opened.
#
# @param logfile An open file to which messages and diagnostics are written.
#
# @param verbosity Increases the volume of trace material written to the logfile.
#
# @param use_mmap Whether to use the mmap module is determined heuristically.
# Use this arg to override the result. Current heuristic: mmap is used if it exists.
#
# @param file_contents ... as a string or an mmap.mmap object or some other behave-alike object.
# If file_contents is supplied, filename will not be used, except (possibly) in messages.
#
# @param encoding_override Used to overcome missing or bad codepage information
# in older-version files. Refer to discussion in the <b>Unicode</b> section above.
# <br /> -- New in version 0.6.0
#
# @param formatting_info Governs provision of a reference to an XF (eXtended Format) object
# for each cell in the worksheet.
# <br /> Default is <i>False</i>. This is backwards compatible and saves memory.
# "Blank" cells (those with their own formatting information but no data) are treated as empty
# (by ignoring the file's BLANK and MULBLANK records).
# It cuts off any bottom "margin" of rows of empty (and blank) cells and
# any right "margin" of columns of empty (and blank) cells.
# Only cell_value and cell_type are available.
# <br /> <i>True</i> provides all cells, including empty and blank cells.
# XF information is available for each cell.
# <br /> -- New in version 0.6.1
#
# @param on_demand Governs whether sheets are all loaded initially or when demanded
# by the caller. Please refer back to the section "Loading worksheets on demand" for details.
# <br /> -- New in version 0.7.1
#
# @param ragged_rows False (the default) means all rows are padded out with empty cells so that all
# rows have the same size (Sheet.ncols). True means that there are no empty cells at the ends of rows.
# This can result in substantial memory savings if rows are of widely varying sizes. See also the
# Sheet.row_len() method.
# <br /> -- New in version 0.7.2
#
# @return An instance of the Book class.
